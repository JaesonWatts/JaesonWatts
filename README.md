### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Thank you for taking the time to stop in and read this! 

I am a highly motivated and progress-focused ex-Deputy Sheriff with a long-standing personal background working with computers. I consider myself to be a talented learner. With a track record of initiative and dependability, I believe I have the drive and talents which will prove valuable to your organization. 

I have been out of the field for a time due to some unexpected medical issues. Everything has been taken care of and I am ready to get back into the workforce. I would be open to elaborate more if you have further questions! 

During my convalescence I have been working at self study of CompTia A+ materials, linux admin practices, and full stack development. 

I believe the skills I have developed over my lifetime as a computerphile as well as the dedicated learning I have been focused on would be a great asset to any company that hires me to the team. I have a basic knowledge of Python and the Pandas library and I am proficient with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Ruby, and Ruby-on-Rails, and continue to learn everyday. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently on track to graduate Flatiron School's Full Time Online Software Engineering Bootcamp on September 4th, 2020.
